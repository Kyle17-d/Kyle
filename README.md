Hi Humans!

Kyle here, There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I always wanted to be a Web Developer even though Self-tought so i'm trying my best to know more about it and i like challanges. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
